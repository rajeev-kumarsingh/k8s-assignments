Create three different pods with different configurations:

Guaranteed QoS:
Define a pod where each container has equal requests and limits for both CPU and memory.
Burstable QoS:
Define a pod where containers request less than they are limited.
BestEffort QoS:
Define a pod with no requests or limits.
